# Forecasting

## Overview

Welcome to the "Forecasting" repository! This repository contains various machine learning and statistical forecasting analyses. It showcases different algorithms and methods applied to time series forecasting problems, including but not limited to ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Prophet, and advanced techniques like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

## Code Examples

### Loading and Preprocessing Data

The code examples in this repository include data loading, preprocessing, and transformation steps necessary for time series analysis, such as handling missing values and feature scaling.

### Model Implementation

Each forecasting model is implemented in its respective script or Jupyter notebook, demonstrating:

- **Training**: How to fit the forecasting model to the historical data.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Techniques for optimizing model parameters.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics and visualizations to assess model performance, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and forecasting plots.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Forecasting.git
   cd Forecasting

2. **Install Dependencies**

    Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install <required libraries>

3. **Run the Notebooks/Scripts**

    Open the Jupyter notebooks or run the Python scripts to execute the regression analyses.

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook

4. **Visualize Results**

    The results, including performance metrics and visualizations, can be found in the respective notebooks or scripts.
